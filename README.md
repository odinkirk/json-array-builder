#json-array-builder


A simple webapp to construct an array of JSON objects.

This app was created to help me build a long array of JSON object for another app I have in mind. Any rational person would just store the info in a database and then load it as necessary. I'm still figuring out AJAX and I wanted to play around anyway, so here we are.

##Roadmap
* Initial functionality
* Controls to delete items from array.
* Controls to raise and lower items in array.
